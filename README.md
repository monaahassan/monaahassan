Hey, my name is Mona(she/her), and I am a software engineer from Detroit, MI!

Hello world! I am an MN native looking for fresh oppurtunities in MI. In 2020 I started at Lambda School and very quickly became a leader to my peers, offering additional instruction to those who need it. I'm here for others and love learning and creating a diverse network.

I take pride in in building relationships and probing for more knowledge.

My Coding Beliefs -- DRY Code: Nothing is worse than having to write the same thing over and over again. I believe you need to let the code do the heavy lifting and write it in a manner that is functional and dynamic. Break It Down: It is best to take big problems and cut them up into bite sized problems. This helps to solve each piece with much more care and speed. Sit Down, Be Humble: You can learn something from everyone if you allow yourself to be humble and listen. Humility is the key ingredient to growing and that is all I have ever aspired to do.
